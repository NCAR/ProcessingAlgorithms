\subsection{Wind\label{sec:WIND}}

\href{http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Bulletins/bulletin23.html}{RAF Bulletin 23}\index{Bulletin 23}
documents the calculation of wind components, both with respect to
the earth (UI, VI, WI, WS and WD) and with respect to the aircraft
(UX and VY). In data processing, a separate function (GUSTO in GENPRO,
gust.c in NIMBUS) is used to derive these wind components. That function
uses the measurements from an Inertial Navigation System (INS\index{INS})
as well as aircraft true airspeed, aircraft angle of attack, and aircraft
sideslip angle. The wind components calculated in GUSTO/gust.c are
used to derive the wind direction (WD) and wind speed (WS). Additional
variables UIC, VIC, WSC, WDC, UXC, and VYC are also calculated based
on the variables VNSC, VEWC discussed in section \ref{subsec:IRS/GPS},
which combine INS and GPS information to obtain improved measurements
of the aircraft motion. Those are usually the highest-quality measurements
of wind because the merged INS/GPS variables combine the high-frequency
response of the INS with the long-term accuracy of the GPS.

There is an extensive discussion of the wind-sensing system and the
uncertainties associated with measurements of wind in this \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D60G3HJ8}{Technical Note}.\index{uncertainty!wind!Technical Note}
The details contained therein and in Bulletin 23 will not be repeated
here, so those documents should be consulted for additional information.
There are two exceptions that are discussed in more detail here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The calculation of vertical wind is described in more detail below
for the variables WI and WIC. 
\item Because measurements obtained by a GPS receiver are often used, the
motion of the GPS receiving antenna\index{motion!GPS antenna} relative
to the IRU must be considered. Standard processing corrects for the
motion of the gust system relative to the IRU arising from aircraft
rotation, but a similar correction is needed because the GPS antenna
is displaced from the IRU. The displacement is almost entirely along
the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, so GPS-measured velocities
like GGVNS, GGVEW, and GGVSPD (denoted here $v_{n}$, $v_{e}$, and
$v_{u}$) are corrected as follows to give measurements that apply
at the location of the IRU. Then these variables can be used in place
of or to complement similar measurements from the IRU in the processing
algorithms. The equations are:\\
\begin{equation}
\delta v_{u}{\rm =-L_{G}\dot{\theta}}\label{eq:pitchr}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta v_{e} & = & -L_{G}\dot{\psi}\,{\rm \cos\psi}\label{eq:GGVEW}\\
\delta v_{n} & = & L_{G}\dot{\psi}{\rm \,\sin\psi}\label{eq:GGVNS}
\end{eqnarray}
where $L_{G}$ is the distance\sindex[lis]{Lg@$L_{G}$=distance from IRU to GPS antenna}
forward along the longitudinal axis from the IRU to the GPS antenna
($-4.30$\,m for the GV, where the GPS receiver is behind the IRU)
and where $\theta$ and $\psi$ respectively represent the pitch and
heading angle. The dots over the attitude-angle symbols represent
time derivatives, so for example $\dot{\theta}$ is the rate of change
of the pitch angle and all angles are expressed in radians. The correction
terms are added to the GPS-measured velocity components so that they
represent the motion of the IRU relative to the Earth.
\end{enumerate}
The variables pertaining to the relative wind are described in the
next subsection, and the variables characterizing the wind are then
described briefly in the last subsection. Some additional detail is
included in cases where procedures are not documented in that earlier
bulletin.

\subsubsection{Relative Wind}

Wind\index{wind!relative} is measured by adding two vectors: (1)
the measured air motion relative to the aircraft (called the relative
wind), and (2) the motion of the aircraft relative to the Earth. The
following are the measurements used to determine the relative wind.
The motion of the aircraft relative to the ground was discussed in
Section \ref{sec:INS}, and the combination of these two vectors to
measure the wind is described in \href{http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Bulletins/bulletin23.html}{RAF Bulletin 23}. 

RAF uses the radome\label{radome gust-sensing system} gust-sensing\index{radome gust probe}\index{gust probe!radome}
technique\footnote{Brown, E.~N, C.~A.~Friehe, and D.~H.~Lenschow, 1983:\emph{ Journal
of Climate and Applied Meteorology,} \textbf{22, }171\textendash 180} to measure incidence angles of the relative wind (i.e., angles of
attack and sideslip). The pressure difference between sensing ports
above and below the center line of the radome is used, along with
the dynamic pressure\index{dynamic pressure} measured at a pitot
tube and referenced to the static pressure source, to determine the
angle of attack. The sideslip angle is determined similarly using
the pressure ports on the starboard and port sides of the radome.
A Rosemount Model 858AJ gust probe\index{gust probe!858AJ} has occasionally
been used for specialized measurements. The radome measurements are
made by differential pressure sensors located in the nose area of
the aircraft and connected to the radome by semi-rigid tubing.

The different variables for TASx (TASF, TASR, etc) use different measurements
of QCxC in the calculation of Mach number. The variable TASxD is the
result of calculations for which the Mach number, air temperature,
and true airspeed are determined for dry instead of humid air. See
the discussion of ATX on page \ref{ATX discussion} for an explanation
of how humidity is handled in the calculation of true airspeed.\\

\uline{toward} the east, VI is the north-south component with positive
values \uline{toward} the north,\index{wind!sign convention} and
WI is the vertical component with positive values toward the zenith.\\
\\
The calculation of WI differs from the description in Bulletin 23
because the output from the inertial reference system is different
for the modern units now in use. The vertical wind is the sum of the
vertical gust component (represented approximately by TASX\,sin(ATTACK-PITCH))
and the motion of the aircraft as measured by VSPD (discussed in Section
\mbox{\pageref{sec:INS}}). Bulletin 23 describes the historical calculation
of the vertical motion of the aircraft via a barometric-inertial feedback
loop, but equivalent calculations (including pressure damping to the
pressure altitude) are incorporated into current IRS units so VSPD
already is the product of such a calculation. To calculate WI, VSPD
is therefore used in place of the obsolete variable WP3 that was discussed
in Bulletin 23.\\
\\
WIC should usually be used instead of WI because VSPD, entering WI,
is updated to the pressure altitude and so can have false variations
in baroclinic conditions. \\
