<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Inertial Reference Systems</h2>
<!-- <h2 id="inertial-reference-systems">Inertial Reference Systems</h2> -->
<p>An Inertial Navigation System (INS) or Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) provides measurements of aircraft position, velocity relative to the Earth, acceleration and attitude or orientation. The IRU provides basic measurements of acceleration and angular rotation rate, while the INS integrates those measurements to track the position, altitude, velocity, and orientation of the aircraft. For the GV, the system is a Honeywell Laseref IV HG2001 GD03 Inertial Reference System; for the C-130, it is a Honeywell Model HG1095-AC03 Laseref V SM Inertial Reference System. These systems are described on the EOL web site, at <a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/inertial-navigation-system-aka-inertial-reference-unit">this URL</a>. Data from the IRS come via a serial digital bit stream (the ARINC digital bus) to the ADS (Aircraft Data System). Because there is some delay in transmission and recording of these variables, adjustments for this delay are made when the measurements are merged into the processed data files, as documented in the NetCDF header files and as discussed in Section <a href="2-3-synchronication-of-measurements.html#synchronication-of-measurements">2.3</a>. Typical delays are about 80 ms for variables including ACINS, PITCH, ROLL, and THDG.</p>
<p>Some variables are recorded only on the original “raw” data tapes and are not usually included in final archived data files; these are discussed at the end of this subsection. See also the discussion in Section <a href="10-obsolete-variables.html#obsolete-variables">10</a> for information on results from inertial systems that were used prior to installation of the present Honeywell systems.<span id="punch3.1" label="punch3.1">[punch3.1]</span></p>
<p>An Inertial Navigation System “aligns” while the aircraft is stationary by measurement of the variations in its reference frame caused by the rotation of the Earth. Small inaccuracy in that alignment leads to a “Schuler oscillation” that produces oscillatory errors in position and other measurements, with a period <span class="math inline"><em>τ</em><sub><em>S</em><em>c</em><em>h</em></sub></span> of about 84 minutes (<span class="math inline"><span class="math inline">\(\tau_{Sch}=2\pi\sqrt{R_{E}/g}\)</span></span>). Position errors of less than 1.0 n mi/h are within normal operating specifications. See Section <a href="3-4-combining-irs-and-gps-measurements.html#combining-irs-and-gps-measurements">3.4</a> for discussion of additional variables, similar to the following, for which corrections are made for these errors via reference to data from a Global Positioning System.</p>
<p>Some projects have used smaller Systron Donner C-MIGITS Inertial Navigation Systems with GPS coupling, usually in connection with special instruments like a wing-mounted wind-sensing system. For these units, variable names usually begin with the letter C but otherwise have names matching the following variables (e.g., CLAT). GPS coupling via a Kalman filter is incorporated in the measurements from these units. They are described at <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/c-migits-insgps-system">this web address</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainties associated with measurements from the IRS are discussed in a Technical Note, available at <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D60G3HJ8">this URL</a>. See page 7 of that document and the tables on pages 41 and 49.</p>
<div id="standard-variables" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Standard Variables</h3>
<p><strong>Latitude (</strong><span class="math inline">º</span><strong>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">LAT</span></strong><br />
<em>The aircraft latitude</em> <em>or angular distance north of the equator in an Earth reference frame</em>. <em></em> Positive values are north of the equator; negative values are south. The resolution is 0.00017<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span> and the accuracy is reported by the manufacturer to be 0.164<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span> after 6 h of flight. Values are provided by the INS at a frequency of 10 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Longitude (</strong><span class="math inline">º</span><strong>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">LON</span><span class="underline"></span><span class="underline"></span></strong><br />
<em>The aircraft longitude</em> or angular distance east of the prime meridian in an Earth reference frame. Positive values are east of the prime meridian; negative values are west. The resolution is 0.00017<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span> and the accuracy is reported by the manufacturer to be 0.164<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span> after 6 h of flight. Values are provided by the INS at a frequency of 10 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft True Heading (</strong><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span><strong>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">THDG</span></strong><br />
<em>The azimuthal angle between the centerline of the aircraft (pointing ahead, toward the nose) and a line of meridian.</em> This azimuthal angle is measured in a polar coordinate system oriented relative to the Earth with polar axis upward and azimuthal angle measured relative to true north. The heading thus indicates the orientation of the aircraft, not necessarily the direction in which the aircraft is traveling. The resolution is 0.00017<span class="math inline">º</span> and the accuracy is quoted by the manufacturer as 0.2<span class="math inline">º</span> after 6 h of flight. Values are provided by the INS at a frequency of 25 Hz. “True” distinguishes the heading from the magnetic heading, the heading that would be measured by a magnetic compass. For more information on the coordinate system used, see <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8152">RAF Bulletin 23</a>.<span id="punch3.2" label="punch3.2">[punch3.2]</span></p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Pitch Attitude Angle (</strong><span class="math inline">º</span><strong>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">PITCH</span></strong><br />
<em>The angle between the centerline of the aircraft (pointing ahead, toward the nose) and the horizontal plane in a reference frame relative to the Earth with polar axis upward.</em> Positive values correspond to the nose of the aircraft pointing above the horizon. The resolution is 0.00017<span class="math inline">º</span> and the accuracy is quoted by the manufacturer as 0.05<span class="math inline">º</span> after 6 h of flight. Values are provided by the INS at a frequency of 50 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Roll Attitude Angle (</strong><span class="math inline">º</span><strong>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">ROLL</span></strong><br />
<em>The angle of rotation about the longitudinal axis of the aircraft required to bring the lateral axis (along the wings) to the horizontal plane.</em> Positive angles indicate that the starboard (right) wing is down ((i.e., a clockwise rotation has occurred from level when facing forward in the aircraft). The resolution is 0.00017<span class="math inline">º</span> and the accuracy is quoted by the manufacturer as 0.05<span class="math inline">º</span> after 6 h of flight. Values are provided by the INS at a frequency of 50 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Vertical Acceleration (m s<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup> − 2</sup></span>):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">ACINS</span></strong><br />
<em>The acceleration upward (relative to the Earth) as measured by an inertial reference unit.</em> With INSs now in use, the internal drift that arises when this measurement is integrated to get aircraft vertical speed and then altitude is removed by the INS via pressure damping through reference to the pressure altitude.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
Positive values are upward. The sample rate is 50 Hz and the resolution is 0.0024 m s<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup> − 2</sup></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Computed Aircraft Vertical Velocity (m/s):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">VSPD</span></strong><br />
<em>The upward velocity of the aircraft, or rate-of-climb relative to the Earth, as measured by the INS.</em> VSPD is determined within the INS by integration of the vertical acceleration, with damping based on measured pressure to correct for accumulated errors in the integration of acceleration. The sample rate is 50 Hz with a resolution of 0.00016 m/s. The Honeywell Laseref INS employs a baro-inertial loop, similar to that described below for WP3 and the Litton LTN-51, to update the value of the acceleration. This variable is also filtered within the INS so that there is little variance with frequency higher than 0.1 Hz.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Rate of Climb (m/s):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">ROC</span></strong> <strong></strong> (new 2017)<strong></strong><br />
<em>The rate of climb or upward speed of the aircraft,</em> as measured by the INS with correction so as to represent the derivative of the geometric height. This variable is calculated by integration of the variable ACINS and then addition of the low-pass-filtered difference between that integral and the climb rate determined from the hydrostatic equation. The result retains the high-frequency response from the INS while matching the low-frequency average value determined from the hydrostatic equation, and so represents change in geometric height. <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/aircraft_ProcessingAlgorithms/blob/master/www/Recommendation161107f.pdf">This memo</a> contains additional background information on this variable.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Pressure-Damped Aircraft Vertical Velocity (m/s):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">WP3</span></strong> (obsolete)<br />
<span id="WP3 algorithm" label="WP3 algorithm"></span>This was a derived variable incorporating a third-order damping feedback loop to remove the drift from the inertial system’s vertical accelerometer (ACINS or VZI) using pressure altitude (PALT) as a long-term, stable reference. Positive values are up. The Honeywell INS now in use provides its own version of this measurement, VSPD, and WP3 is now considered obsolete (and in any case should not be calculated from ACINS as provided by the Honeywell Laseref IRS because that ACINS already incorporates pressure damping). Documentation is included here because many old data files include this variable. Note that “pressure altitude” is not a true altitude but an altitude equivalent to the ambient pressure in a standard atmosphere, so updating a variable integrated from inertial measurements to this value can introduce errors vs. the true altitude.. WP3 was calculated by the data-processing software as follows (with coefficients in historical use and not updated to the recommendations elsewhere in this technical note):<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>

<p><strong>Inertial Altitude (m):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">ALT</span></strong><br />
<em>The altitude of the aircraft as provided by an INS</em>, with pressure damping applied within the INS to the integrated aircraft vertical velocity to avoid the accumulation of errors. The value therefore is updated to the pressure altitude, not the geometric altitude, and should be regarded as a measurement of pressure altitude that has short-term variations as provided by the INS. The sample rate is 25 Hz with a resolution of 0.038 m. In some projects ALT also referred to the altitude from the avionics GPS system; the preferred and current variable name for that is ALT_G.<span id="punch3.10" label="punch3.10">[punch3.10]</span></p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Ground Speed (m/s):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">GSF</span></strong><br />

<p><strong>Distance East/North of a Reference (km):</strong> <strong><span class="underline">DEI</span>/<span class="underline">DNI</span></strong><br />
<em>Distance east or north of a project-dependent reference point.</em> These are derived outputs obtained by subtracting a fixed reference position from the current position. The values are determined from measurements of latitude and longitude and converted from degrees to distance in a rectilinear coordinate system. The reference position can be either the starting location of the flight or a user-defined reference point (e.g., the location of a project radar). The accuracy of these values is dependent on the accuracy of the source of latitude and longitude measurements (see LAT and LON), and the calculations are only appropriate for short distances because they do not take into account the spherical geometry of the Earth.<span id="punch:3.11" label="punch:3.11">[punch:3.11]</span><br /></p>

<li id="fn7"><p>For earlier projects using the Litton LTN-51 INS, this is a direct measurement without adjustment for changes in gravity during flight and without pressure-damping. Previous use employed a baro-inertial loop to compensate for drift in the integrated measurement.

<li id="fn8"><p>Regarding signs, note that ACINS is a number near zero, not near g, and so already has the estimated acceleration of gravity removed.

If <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span>, the estimate for gravity at the flight altitude (palt) and latitude (lat), is <em>smaller</em> than <span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span> then the difference (<span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> − <em>g</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) will be positive; this will correct for the reference value for ACINS being the gravity measured at alignment (<span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>) when it should actually be the sensed gravity (<span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) at the measurement point, so to obtain (sensed acceleration - <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) it is necessary to add (<span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> − <em>g</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) to ACINS, <em>increasing</em> “acz” in this case. However, the situation with “vcorac” is reversed: “vcorac” is a positive term for all eastward flight, for example, but in that case the motion of the aircraft makes objects seem lighter (i.e., they experience less acceleration of gravity) than without such flight. ACINS is positive upward so it represents a net acceleration of the aircraft upward (as imposed by the combination of gravity and the lift force of the aircraft). To accomplish level flight in these circumstances, the aircraft must actually accelerate downward so the accelerometer will experience a negative excursion relative to slower flight. To compensate, “vcorac” must make a positive contribution to remove that negative excursion from “acz”. In the conceptual extreme that the aircraft flies fast enough for the interior to appear weightless, ACINS would reduce to -1<span>*</span><span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span> and vcorac would increase to +<span class="math inline"><em>G</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span>, leaving acz near zero as required if the aircraft were to remain in level flight in the rotating frame.<a href="3-1-inertial-reference-systems.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
