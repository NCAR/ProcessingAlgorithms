<h1><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Obsolete Variables</h1>
<p>
RAF retired the “GENPRO” processor, the software program previously used to produce data sets, in 1993, but data files produced by that processor are still retained and available for use. Also, there are some instruments that are now retired but provided measurements in some archived data files. Obsolete variable names that are associated only with GENPRO or a retired instrument are discussed below, for reference and to facilitate use of old data files.
</p>
<div id="ophir-air-temperature-c-oat" class="section level4" number="10.0.0.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">10.0.0.1</span> Ophir Air Temperature (<span class="math inline"><sup>∘</sup></span>C): OAT</h4>
<em>The radiometric temperature reported by the Ophir III radiometer,</em> which operates on the same principles as the ITR,<span id="OAT" label="OAT">[OAT]</span> with the same limitations. The in-cloud air temperature radiometer is a later, improved version. The Ophir III has been retired.
</p>
</div>
<div id="tptime" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Unaltered Tape Time (s): TPTIME</h4>
This variable is derived by converting the HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND to elapsed seconds after midnight of the current day. If time increments to the next day, its value is not reset to zero, but 86400 seconds are added to produce ever-increasing values for the data set.
</p>
</div>
<div id="hgm" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Geometric Radio Altitude (m): HGM</h4>
<p><em>The distance to the surface below the aircraft,</em> measured by a radar altimeter. The maximum range is 762m (2,500 ft). The instrument changes in accuracy at an altitude of 152 m: The estimated error from 152 m to 762 m is 7%, while the estimated error for altitudes below 152 m is 1.5 m or 5%, whichever is greater.</p>
</div>
<div id="altx" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Altitude, Reference (m MSL): ALTX (Obsolete), GGALTC (Obsolete)</h4>
<p><em>Derived altitude above the geopotential surface,</em> obtained by combining information from a GPS receiver and an inertial reference system. This variable was intended to compensate for times when GPS reception was lost by incorporating information from the IRS measurement of altitude. GPS status measurements were used to detect signal loss, although sometimes this signal was delayed for a few seconds after the signal was lost. A 10-second running average was calculated of the difference between the GPS altitude and the reference altitude. When the sample-to-sample altitude difference changed more than 50 meters or when the GPS status detected a degraded signal, the derived variable (ALTX or GGALTC) became the alternate reference altitude adjusted by the latest running-average difference between that reference altitude and GGALT. When reception was recovered, to avoid a sudden discontinuity in altitude, the derived variable was adjusted back to the GPS altitude gradually over the next 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
This obsolete variable should be used with caution because the reference altitude used in past calculations was the IRS altitude updated to the pressure altitude of the aircraft. To account for the difference between pressure and geometric altitude, a regression equation was used, normally <span class="math inline"><em>z</em> = <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>a</em><sub>1</sub> <em> </em>PALT*</span> where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>0</sub> =  − 46.3</span> m and <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.97866</span> but often adjusted dependent on project conditions. This introduced problems in early applications with the GV because it did not account for the pressure-altitude transition at the ISA tropopause. Use of a pressure altitude as reference introduces additional errors in altitude in regions that are not barotropic.<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="ptime" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Processor Time (s): PTIME</h4>
This is an internal time variable created by the GENPRO processor. It represents elapsed seconds after midnight. It differs from TPTIME in that, after it has been set at the beginning of the data set, it is incremented internally for each second of data processed. If duplicate or missing raw data records exist, it can differ from TPTIME. It is guaranteed to be a monotonically increasing and continuous series of values.
</p>
</div>
<div id="tmlag" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>INS: Data System Time Lag (s): TMLAG</h4>
TMLAG is the amount of time between the reference time of a Litton LTN-5l Inertial Navigation System (INS) and the data system clock, in seconds. TMLAG will always be greater than zero and less than 2.
</p>
</div>
<div id="loranc" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>LORAN-C Variables:</h4>
<strong> Latitude and Longitude (</strong><span class="math inline">º</span><strong>): CLAT, CLON</strong><br />
<strong>Circular Error of Probability (n mi): CCEP</strong><br />
<strong>Ground Speed (m/s): CGS</strong><br />
<strong>Status: CSTAT</strong><br />
<strong>Time (s): CSEC</strong><br />
<strong>Fractional Time (s): CFSEC</strong>
</p>
<p>Before the advent of GPS, NCAR/RAF operated a LORAN-C receiver that provided information on the position and groundspeed of the aircraft. The measurements of latitude and longitude from this system are CLAT and CLON, measured at 1 Hz and with positive values of longitude to the east and positive values of latitude to the north. and CCEP provides an estimate of the uncertainty in those measurements (in units of nautical miles). A status word, CSTAT, was used to record a value of 15 when the system was operational. The ground speed and reference times were also recorded in the above corresponding variables. The sum of CSEC and CFSEC represented the time of the measurement, which was not always the time in the data file when the measurements were recorded.</p>
</div>
<div id="wp3" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Pressure-Damped Aircraft Vertical Velocity (m/s): WP3</h4>
<p><span id="WP3 algorithm" label="WP3 algorithm"></span>This was a derived variable incorporating a third-order damping feedback loop to remove the drift from the inertial system’s vertical accelerometer (ACINS or VZI) using pressure altitude (PALT) as a long-term, stable reference. Positive values are up. The Honeywell INS now in use provides its own version of this measurement, VSPD, and WP3 is now considered obsolete (and in any case should not be calculated from ACINS as provided by the Honeywell Laseref IRS because that ACINS already incorporates pressure damping). Documentation is included here because many old data files include this variable. Note that “pressure altitude” is not a true altitude but an altitude equivalent to the ambient pressure in a standard atmosphere, so updating a variable integrated from inertial measurements to this value can introduce errors vs. the true altitude. WP3 was calculated by the data-processing software as follows (with coefficients in historical use and not updated to the recommendations elsewhere in this technical note):<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>

</p>
These variables from the Litton LTN-51 Inertial Navigation System (INS) are analogous to the modern variables discussed in Section <a href="3-the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#inertial-reference-systems">3.1</a> The measurements of latitude and longitude were provided with 1-Hz frequency and had a resolution of 0.0014<span class="math inline">º</span>, while the ground speed components were provided at 10 Hz and had resolution equal to 0.012 m/s. The X component of the ground speed was along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft <em>at the time of alignment,</em> and the Y axis was in the starboard direction at the time of alignment. PHDG recorded the orientation of the platform relative to true north, with resolution 0.0028<span class="math inline">º</span>. THI was the true heading of the aircraft, produced at 5 Hz with resolution of 0.0014<span class="math inline">º</span>. The “wander angle” is an INS-only variable that recorded the angle of the INS platform x-axis relative to its original orientation; it “wandered” in response to east-west motion of the aircraft on a spherical Earth.

<h4>Raw Cloud Technology (Johnson-Williams) Liquid Water Content (<span class="math inline"><em>g</em>/<em>m</em><sup>3</sup></span>): LWC</h4>
<p>This is the raw output of a Johnson-Williams liquid water content sensor converted to units of grams per cubic meter. The Johnson-Williams indicator measures the evaporative cooling caused by the latent heat of vaporization of droplets contacting the heated sensing element by sensing changes in its resistance as it cools.

A “compensation” wire is also mounted in the J-W sensor, parallel to the droplet stream, to compensate for cooling effects of the airstream. Typically the instrument is set for a true airspeed of 200 knots. The instrument must be zeroed in “cloud-free air.” The Johnson-Williams liquid water content sensor is designed for the cloud droplet spectrum.

<strong>Corrected Dew Point Temperature (<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span>): DPCRC</strong><br /></p>
<p>The first two of these measurements were made directly in the chamber of the cryogenic hygrometer, a now obsolete cabin-mounted instrument connected to outside air by an inlet line. VCRH was determined from a third-order calibration equation applied to the voltage measured by the instrument.
The corrected frost point and dew point temperatures are those determined after corrections are applied to the direct measurements from a cryogenic hygrometer. These measurements were from a now obsolete instrument but the variables are included here because they appear in some old data files. To obtain estimates of the ambient frost point and dew point, the measurements made inside the chamber of the cryogenic hygrometer (CVRH and CRHP) must be corrected for the difference in water vapor pressure between that chamber and ambient conditions. The ratio of the chamber pressure to the ambient pressure is assumed to be the same as the ratio of the chamber vapor pressure to the ambient vapor pressure. The vapor pressure in the chamber was determined from the Goff-Gratch (1946) equation<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>
for saturation vapor pressure with respect to a plane ice surface. This vapor pressure was then used with CRHP and a measure of the ambient pressure (PSXC) to determine the vapor pressure in the outside air, and this was converted to an equivalent dew-point. The instrument was only used for measurements of frost point less than -15<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>∘</sup></span>C because it did not function well above that frost point.

<p><strong><br />
</strong>Corrected Carbon Monoxide Concentration (ppmv): COCAL**<br /></p>
<p>CMODE records if the CO analyzer is supplied with air from which CO has been removed and so is recording its zero level. When CMODE is less than 0.2 V, the instrument is in the normal operational mode, and when CMODE is greater than 8.0 V the instrument is in the “zero” mode. When measurements are processed, the zero-mode signals are represented by a cubic spline to obtain a reference baseline for the signal (COZRO), and this baseline is subtracted from the measured value (CO) to obtain COCOR. This variable still jumps to zero periodically and does not include the calibration that enters the corrected variable, COCAL, which is the calibrated signal from the CO instrument after correction for drift of the baseline and after application of the appropriate calibration coefficients to produce units of ppmv. The quality of the baseline fit can be judged by examining the offset at the zero points. If there are relatively small changes in the baseline, the zero offset will be only a few ppbv. If there have been rapid changes in the baseline, the zero offset can be up to 50 ppbv. The magnitude of the offset at the zero values gives a good measure of uncertainty in the data set. The detection limit is 10 ppbv, with an uncertainty of <span class="math inline"> ± 15%</span>. At 1 Hz, data will have considerable variability, so 10-s averaging is often useful when the measurements are used for analysis.</p>

<h4>Derived Supercooled Liquid Water Content (g/m<sup>3</sup>): SCLWC</h4>

The output is not valid during the probe deicing cycle. This cycle is apparent in the RICE output (a peak followed by a decrease to near zero). Supercooled liquid water content is determined by first calculating a water drop impingement rate which is a function of the effective surface area, the collection efficiency, the true airspeed, and the supercooled liquid water content. The impingement rate obtained is equated to the accreted mass of ice collected by the probe in one second (empirical voltage/mass relationship). The resulting equation is solved for supercooled water content.

<h4>FSSP-100 Total Strobes (number per sample interval): FSTB, FSTROB</h4>
<p><em>The rate at which strobes are generated in an FSSP-100 probe.</em> A “strobe” is generated in the FSSP-100 whenever a particle is detected within its depth-of-field. Not all such particles are accepted for inclusion in the size distribution, however, because some pass through the outer regions of the illuminating laser beam and therefore produce shorter and smaller-amplitude pulses than those passing through the center of the beam. The probe maintains a running estimate of the average transit time and rejects particles with transit times shorter than this average. The total number of strobes recorded is therefore more than the number of sized particles, and the ratio of strobes to accepted particles can indicate quality of operation of the probe. Also, the strobes require processing and so contribute to the dead time of the probe, affecting the concentration unless a correction is made. See <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8155">RAF Bulletin 24</a> for more discussion on the operation of the “old” FSSP.</p>

However, the situation with “vcorac” is reversed: “vcorac” is a positive term for all eastward flight, for example, but in that case the motion of the aircraft makes objects seem lighter (i.e., they experience less acceleration of gravity) than without such flight. ACINS is positive upward so it represents a net acceleration of the aircraft upward (as imposed by the combination of gravity and the lift force of the aircraft). To accomplish level flight in these circumstances, the aircraft must actually accelerate downward so the accelerometer will experience a negative excursion relative to slower flight. To compensate, “vcorac” must make a positive contribution to remove that negative excursion from “acz”.
