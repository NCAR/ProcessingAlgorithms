by not having ``X'' at the end. Consider name change? & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:4-13} & The variable WIC is described as ``GPS-corrected'' but that is misleading
because it is really based, for aircraft motion, solely on GPS in
recent usage (where dependence is on GGVSPD). Contrast to WDC/WSC
which are really GPS-corrected. Suggest a different name, like ``Wind
Vector, Vertical Component, using GPS''? & \tabularnewline

UHSAS: T and P in canister including UPRESS intensity, etc., better
in sect 7 & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:5-6} & REFF2DC seems mis-named; all others based on 1D sizing from 2D have
names involving 2DC & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:6-1} & need Teresa and/or Andy W to check this section & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:6-3} & need to understand and document what te03c.c does, and perhaps move
to obsolete? & \tabularnewline
\hline

for NOy? & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:6-4} & In true measurement mode, XNOZA and XNZAF will be near zero -- is
this right? & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:6-5} & I think the corrected-NO mixing ratio section may need revision? & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:6-6} & ``has the provision for the addition of water vapor '' -- does
that mean this is always done, or only sometimes? & \tabularnewline

\pageref{punch:10-3} & For old cryogenic hygrometer, find and include the 3rd-order equation
referenced here & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:10-4} & check Goff-Gratch formulas; there was some ambiguity in what was in
B9 & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:10-5} & Should include basic equation for SWTC & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:10-6} & re TECO CO: is the direct measurement (ppb) a mass ratio? Need explanation
here if so to describe difference between ppb and ppbv & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:10-7} & COCAL: how does this differ from XCOMR? Why is this in the ``obsolete''
section? Same for O3FS? & \tabularnewline
\hline 
\pageref{punch:10-8} & For SCLWC, this is missing crucial information like how accreted mass
is obtained from voltage. Couldn't find the algorithm. Consider Mazin
version? Or old one for Wyo KA? & \tabularnewline

involving FSSP processing, that are not included here. & \tabularnewline

\section*{How to Edit This Document}

Here are some notes regarding the construction and structure of this
document:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The reference version is ProcessingAlgorithms.lyx, which needs 'LyX',
a user interface to TeX. It is available on EOL machines like tikal.
Start it with ``lyx ProcessingAlgorithms.lyx''
\item The document is broken into many sections, referenced by the above
file, so they must be present also. Then have names like Section3.lyx
\item The document generates three indices: a regular index, a list of symbols,
and a list of variables. The references for these are embedded in
the .lyx files, and they can be modified or more can be added via
the ``Insert -> Index Entry'' controls. These practices are useful
when generating index entries:
\begin{enumerate}
\item entries like 'wind!relative' will generate index entries as subordinate
entries with 'relative' below 'wind'
\item I have tried to emphasize using nouns to start index entries, so for
example I would favor ``coefficient!calibration'' over ``calibration
coefficient.
\item It is sometimes useful to generate ``see xxx'' entries, which can
be done as follows: ``INS|see \{Inertial Navigation System\}'' where
the part in braces is also in LaTeX code, generated by pressing CNTL-L.
\end{enumerate}
\item Creating a PDF-format file in LyX usually will generate these lists
also. To be safe and ensure that the lists are updated, follow these
steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Export a LaTeX file from LyX in pdflatex format, using the ``export''
option.
\item Run ``pdflatex ProcessingAlgorithms'' three times to be sure all
references are resolved.
\item Run ``splitindex ProcessingAlgorithms'' to generate files for the
lists.
\item Run ``makeindex ProcessingAlgorithms'' to generate the lists.
\item Run ``pdflatex ProcessingAlgorithms'' again.
\end{enumerate}
\item The LyX files have embedded notes with additional information that
should be retained, and exporting to LaTeX will lose this information,
so it will be useful to retain the LyX format. The suggested next
steps in the table above, for example, almost all have associated
notes that will appear in yellow and will help identify where the
comment applies.
\item It is sometimes easiest to edit the PDF file directly. Some of the
web references have been changed in this way and can be adjusted as
the reference files are moved, e.g., from my Google Drive to the EOL
web pages. For this purpose, I found master-pdf-editor useful. This
will lose continuity, however, because then the links can't be re-generated
by running LyX.
\item As of Feb 2019, manylinks formerly to google-drive addresses or eol
system files have been changed to https://github.com/NCAR/aircraft\_ProcessingAlgorithms
links. In that directory there is a file ('links') with a list of
all the links in the document. It is worthwhile when updating this
document to check that all the links remain current. One way is to
use these R statements: \\
links <- readlines('./links'); EURL <- rep(FALSE, length(links));\\
for (i in 1:length(links)) \{EURL{[}i{]} <- RCurl::url.exists(links{[}i{]})\}\\
\#\# and then check EURL to see that the links are all found.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{How to Reference Specific Sections or Pages of this Document:}

\subsection*{Variables}

The document includes named destinations for each variable name, so
when used in a URL that destination can be reached. This is done differently
in different browsers or PDF viewers:
\begin{itemize}
\item For a web browser like Chrome or Firefox, use the ``nameddest''
reference; e.g., for the discussion of variable ATX, use\\
\texttt{firefox http://www.eol.ucar.edu/system/files/ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf\#nameddest=ATX}
\item For a pdf viewer like evince, use this syntax:\\
\texttt{evince -n ATX http://www.eol.ucar.edu/system/files/ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf}
\end{itemize}
Most variable names can be used in these URL modifiers. Here is a
list of available targets by section in the report:

\subsection*{Page Numbers}

To reference a specific page in the document, use a web reference
like this:\\
\texttt{ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf\#page=44}

In evince, this syntax will work, or the page number can be specified
in this way:

\texttt{evince -p 115 ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf}

\subsection*{Sections and Subsections}

Targets have not been provided for other parts of the document, but
the above method of referencing pages can be used to link to specific
sections and other components of the document.

\subsection*{Adding New Targets}

When a new variable is added, a new anchor point can be added by inserting,
in LaTeX mode, \texttt{\textbackslash nop\{LAT\} }at the appropriate
point in the LyX document. (\textbackslash nop has been defined to
use \textbackslash hypertarget but displace the reference upward
one line.) In addition, when a new variable is added, entries should
be made in the index items and the variable-names list, following
the pattern used for existing variables, and if appropriate any new
symbols used in discussing the algorithm should be added to the similar
symbols list.
